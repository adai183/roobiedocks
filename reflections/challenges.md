## Challenges
<br>
My biggest challenge is to stay focused and not become a too diffuse learning.
There is so many interesting stuff to learn and I think it is very hard to make decisions and limit myself on a certain expertise. 
I am actually also very interested in Data Science and would love to learn more about machine learning.
But I think it definitely makes more sense for me now to do courses like this ruby course or the senior frontend course. My problem is I want to learn it all.

Do you know a job profile where I can combine data science and web development in a efficient way?

How do you manage to stay focused?

Would you recommend to learn other frameworks besides rails like node.js?
