## Background 
<br>
I have been a professional dancer for the last five years and did a drastic career change 8 months ago. I really got into coding completing Udacityâ€™s Introduction into Programming  Nanodegree.
After that I took their Front end degree, which I finished with exceeds specs a few days ago. <br><br>

I would call myself a "Frontend Ninja Apprentice" eager to gain more technological empathy!<br><br>

## Transferable Skills
* I am not new to programming. I already know what it means to think like a programmer thanks to my previous Udacity adventures. 
* I am a german dude who has been living in Madrid for the last 8 years. I have good communication skills and like learning new languages. Obviously that is very helpful to learn computer languages and write clean and expressive code
* Having been a dancer and choreographer has given me a sense for esthetics and I am interested in the gap between code and design.
